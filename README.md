# Deep-Learning

In this repository, I dive into foundational machine learning concepts and practical techniques. Current practices include addressing overfitting and underfitting with methods like early stopping, using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization, and experimenting with neural networks for tasks like handwritten digit recognition. This repository reflects an ongoing journey in model optimization, performance tuning, and other essential areas of machine learning.
